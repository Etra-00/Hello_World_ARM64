### Description
This project is a simple "Hello World" written in ARM64 Assembly.
It was written as practice for myself, as well as a sort of motivator to look back on as I progress.
The 'main.s' file is heavily commented for my own reference, but feel free to check it out yourself if you're trying to dip a toe in low-level programming.


### Last Words
Do something to make yourself happy today.
Have a lovely one. ü§ç
